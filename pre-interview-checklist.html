    <h3>Interviews</h3>
   <p>All jobs involve a face-to-face interview, so do your homework about your potential new employer beforehand! Try to anticipate likely questions - and look at the company's website to find out all you can about them. Prepare to ask your interviewers questions too; it shows you're intelligent, interested!
    </p> 
   <p>Interviews are a two-way exchange of information. Obviously, the interviewer is trying to find out about you but you are also finding out about them, forming an impression of what it would be like to work for them and deciding whether you would like to join them. Given this two-way exchange, you must be clear about what you want to get out of the interview and how you can win over the interviewer and ensure they get to know about you.
